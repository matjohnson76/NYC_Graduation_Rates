Statistical Analysis on NYC's Department of Education's Graduation Results for Classes of 2005 to 2020


This study analyzes the data provided by the New York City Department of Education on 
graduating classes from 2005 to 2020 from a computational statistics perspective. Inferential 
results of six different statistical inquiries are presented and analyzed using R Studio as a statistical 
analysis tool. The inquiries target multiple attributes such as school size, racial composition, 
economic status of students across the five boroughs of New York City. Multiple statistical tests 
are utilized to reach conclusions that allow for a in depth understanding of the factors affecting 
graduation rates across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The results of 
this analysis show that there is a discrepancy between the graduation rates of assigned genders 
(male and female), there exist similarities between graduation rates across different boroughs, 
economic disadvantage does not affect the graduation rate, in addition to some other insights into 
the components that play a role in graduation rates across the five boroughs of New York City.
